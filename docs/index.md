This website is intended to be a single repository for most Medicare data documentation needs.

The [NBER Documentation](NBER_website/1_Overview.md) section holds reformatted pages sourced from the National Bureau of Economic Research's [public Medicare documentation](https://www.nber.org/medicare/public/Public.html) (free log in required). The [ResDAC Documentation](resdac/carrier-rif.md) section holds codebooks and variable descriptions scraped from the ResDAC website.

The other tabs hold user-written documentation.

This website is easily searchable. Click on the search bar at the top or use the <kbd>F</kbd> or <kbd>S</kbd> keys to bring up a responsive search. Try searching for `clm_id` to find the page for the "Claim ID" variable. Note, this search may be slow on first use while your browser indexes the site.


## Contributing

This website is created using a site generator sourced from a Github repository. This means that you can easily contribute! Click on the edit icon on a page to get to the source file on Github.

[Here's](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) a helpful cheatsheet for basic formatting in markdown.

On an institutional claim, the national provider identifier (NPI) number assigned to uniquely identify the physician who has overall responsibility for the beneficiary's care and treatment.

NOTE: Effective May 2007, the NPI will be- come the national standard identifier for covered health care providers. NPIs will replace current OSCAR provider number, UPINs, NSC numbers, and local contractor provider identification numbers (PINs) on standard HIPPA claim transactions. (During the NPI transition phase (4/3/06 - 5/23/07) the capability was there for the NCH to receive NPIs along with an existing legacy number (UPIN, PIN, OSCAR provider number, etc.)).

NOTE1: CMS has determined that dual provider identifiers (old legacy numbers and new NPI) must be available in the NCH. After the 5/07 NPI implementation, the standard system main- tainers will add the legacy number to the claim when it is adjudicated. We will continue to receive the OSCAR provider number and any currently issued UPINs. Effective May 2007, no NEW UPINs (legacy number) will be generated for NEW physicians (Part B and Outpatient claims), so there will only be NPIs sent in to the NCH for those physicians.

Effective with Version H, the date care started for the HHA services reported on the institutional claim with a from date greater than 3/31/98. The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) required that this field be present on all HHA claims.

NOTE1: Beginning with NCH weekly process date 4/3/98, this field was populated with data. Claims processed prior to 4/3/98 will contain zeroes in this field.

NOTE2: Effective with Version 'I', the start of care date will be moved from the 1st eight positions of the Claim Treatment Authorization Number. Prior to Version 'I' this date was moved from Occurrence Code 27 date field.

Data Variable Alert: The Claim HHA Care Start Date variable (CLM_ADMSN_DT) is often missing in the 2011-2012 claims. CMS has since corrected the issue for 2013 onward. However, CMS has no plans to fix the 2011-2012 claims.

Contained in

Effective with Version H, the count of the number of HHA visits as derived by CWF.

NOTE1: During the Version H conversion this field was populated with data throughout history (back to service year 1991) using the CWF derivation rule (units associated with revenue center codes 042X, 043X, 044X, 055X, 056X, 057X, 058X and 059X. Value `999` will be displayed if the sum of the revenue center unit count equals or exceeds `999`.

NOTE2: Effective 7/1/99, all HHA claims received with service from dates 7/1/99 and after will be processed as if the units field contains the 15 minute interval count; and each visit revenue code line item will be counted as ONE visit. This field is calculated correctly; but those users who derive the count themselves they will have to revise their routine. NO LONGER IS THE COUNT DERIVED BY ADDING UP THE UNITS FIELDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE HHA VISIT REVENUE CODES.

The reason that no Medicare payment is made for services on an institutional claim.

NOTE1: This field was put on all institutional claim types but data did not start coming in on OP/HHA/Hospice until 4/1/02. Prior to 4/1/02, data only came in Inpatient/SNF claims.

NOTE2: Effective 4/1/02, this field was also expanded to two bytes to accommodate new values. The NCH Nearline file did not expand the current 1-byte field but instituted a crosswalk of the 2-byte field to the 1-byte character value. See table of code for the crosswalk.

NOTE3: Effective with Version 'J', the field has been expanded on the NCH claim to 2 bytes. With this expansion the NCH will no longer use the character values to represent the official two byte values being sent in by CWF since 4/2002.

During the Version 'J' conversion, all character values were converted to the two byte values.

NOTE4: These code values were not identified as part of the original CMS data documentation.  ResDAC has identified the values and has provided them for convenience.

Effective 4/1/02, the Medicare nonpayment reason code was expanded to a 2-byte field.  The NCH instituted a crosswalk from the 2-byte code to a 1-byte character code. Below are the character codes (found in NCH & NMUD). At some point, NMUD will carry the 2-byte code but NCH will continue to have the 1-byte character code.

On an institutional claim, the National Provider Identifier (NPI) number assigned to uniquely identify the physician with the primary responsibility for performing the surgical procedure(s).

NOTE: Effective May 2007, the NPI will become the national standard identifier for covered health care providers. NPIs will replace the current OSCAR provider number, UPINs, NSC numbers, and local contractor provider identi- fication numbers (PINs) on standard HIPPA claim transactions. (During the NPI transition phase (4/3/06 - 5/23/07) the capability was there for the NCH to receive NPIs along with an existing legacy number (UPIN, PIN, OSCAR provider number, etc.)).

NOTE1: CMS has determined that dual provider identifiers (old legacy number and new NPI) must be available in the NCH. After the 5/07 NPI implementation, the standard system maint- tainers will add the legacy number to the claim when its adjudicated. We will continue to re- ceive the OSCAR provider number and any currently issued UPINs. Effective May 2007, no NEW UPINs (legacy numbers) will be generated for NEW physicians (Part B and outpatient claims), so there will only be NPIs sent in to the NCH for those physicians.

The code used to identify the CMS specialty code corresponding to the operating physician. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides for incentive payments for physicians and non-physician practitioners with specific primary specialty designations. In order to determine if the physician or non-physicians is eligible for the incentive payment, the specialty code, NPI and name must be carried on the claims.

On an institutional claim, the National Provider Identifier (NPI) number assigned to uniquely identify the other physician associated with the institutiohal claim.

NOTE: Effective May 2007, the NPI will be- come the national standard identifier for covered health care providers. NPIs will replace current OSCAR provider number, UPINs, NSC numbers, and local contractor provider identification numbers (PINs) on standard HIPPA claim transactions. (During the NPI transition phase (4/3/06 - 5/23/07) the capability was there for the NCH to receive NPIs along with an existing legacy number (UPIN, PIN, OSCAR provider number, etc.)).

NOTE1: CMS has determined that dual provider identifiers (old legacy numbers and new NPI) must be available in the NCH. After the 5/07 NPI implementation, the standard system main- tainers will add the legacy number to the claim when it is adjudicated. We will continue to receive the OSCAR provider number and any currently issued UPINs. Effective May 2007, no NEW UPINs (legacy number) will be generated for NEW physicians (Part B AND outpatient claims), so there will only be NPIs sent in to the NCH for those physicians.

The code used to identify the CMS specialty code corresponding to the other physician. 

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) provides for incentive payments for physicians and non-physician practitioners with specific primary specialty designations. In order to determine if the physician or non-physician is eligible for the incentive payment, the specialty code, NPI and name must be carried on the claims.

This variable is the National Provider Identifier (NPI) for the physician who rendered the services. NPIs replaced UPINs as the standard provider identifiers beginning in 2007. The UPIN is almost never populated after 2009. 

CMS has determined that dual provider identifiers (old legacy numbers and new NPI) must be available in the NCH. After the 5/07 NPI implementation, the standard system maintainers will add the legacy number to the claim when it is adjudicated. We will continue to receive the OSCAR provider number and any currently issued UPINs. Effective May 2007, no new UPINs (legacy numbers) will be generated for new physicians (Part B and outpatient claims), so there will only be NPIs sent in to the NCH for those physicians.

Effective with Version G, the total charges for all services included on the institutional claim. This field is redundant with revenue center code 0001/total charges.

??? limitation
	DESCRIPTION :
	The total charge amount field in the fixed portion was
	truncated on outpatient, hospice and home health claims.
	BACKGROUND :
	For outpatient, hospice and home health claims, the
	total charge amount field in the fixed portion was
	truncated (the cents were dropped off; the decimal
	point was moved, making cents out of dollars) in the
	CWFMQA process beginning with data received from CWF
	1/4/99 through 5/14/99. The problem occurred when
	CWF increased the size of the field.
	CORRECTIVE ACTION :
	The CWFMQA front-end was fixed. The Nearline was patched during the quarterly merge in 7/99 for service years 1998 and 1999. The NCH_PACTCH_CD field will be populated with a value '11'. The 1998 and 1999 SAFs were corrected when finalized in 7/99. The patch involved moving the total charge amount in the revenue center trailer to the total charge amount field in the fixed portion, for records with NCH Daily Process Date 1/4/99 - 5/14/99.

The unique CCW indentifier for a beneficiary. The CCW assigns a unique beneficiary identification number to each individual who receives Medicare and/or Medicaid, and uses that number to identify an individual’s records in all CCW data files (e.g., Medicare claims, MAX claims, MDS assessment data). This number does not change during a beneficiary’s lifetime and each number is used only once. The BENE_ID is specific to the CCW and is not applicable to any other identification system or data source.

The identification number assigned by CMS to a fiscal intermediary authorized to process institutional claim records. Effective October 2006, the Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) began replacing the existing fiscal intermediaries and started processing institu- tional claim records for states assigned to its jurisdiction. NOTE: The 5-position MAC number will be housed in the existing FI_NUM field. During the transition from an FI to a MAC the FI_NUM field could contain either a FI number or a MAC number. See the FI_NUM table of codes to identify the new MAC numbers and their effective dates.

On an institutional claim, the National Provider Identifier (NPI) number assigned to uniquely identify the institutional provider certified by Medicare to provide services to the beneficiary.

NOTE: Effective May 2007, the NPI will be- come the national standard identifier for covered health care providers. NPIs will replace current OSCAR provider number, UPINs, NSC numbers, and local contractor provider identification numbers (PINs) on standard HIPPA claim transactions. (During the NPI transition phase (4/3/06 - 5/23/07) the capability was there for the NCH to receive NPIs along with an existing legacy number (UPIN, PIN, OSCAR provider number, etc.)).

NOTE1: CMS has determined that dual provider identifiers (old legacy numbers and new NPI) must be available in the NCH. After the 5/07 NPI implelmentation, the standard system main- tainers will add the legacy number to the claim when it is adjudicated. We will continue to receive the OSCAR provider number and any currently issued UPINs. Effective May 2007, no NEW UPINs (legacy number) will be generated for NEW physicians (Part B and outpatient claims), so there will only be NPIs sent in to the NCH for those physicians.

| CO     | Contractual Obligations -- this group code should be used when a contractual agreement between the payer and payee, or a regulatory requirement, resulted in an adjustment. Generally, these adjustments are considered a write-off for the provider and are not billed to the patient.                 |
| CR     | Corrections and Reversals - this group code should be used for correcting a prior claim. It applies when there is a change to a previously adjudicated claim.                                                                                                                                           |

| PI     | Payer Initiated Reductions -- this group code should be used when, in the opinion of the payer, the adjustment is not the responsibility of the patient, but there is no supporting contract between the provider and the payer (i.e., medical review or professional review organization adjustments). |
| PR     | Patient Responsibility - this group should be used when the adjustment represents an amount that should be billed to the patient or insured. This group would typically be used for deductible and copay adjustments.                                                                                   |

## [Revenue Center (Medicare) Provider Payment Amount](https://www.resdac.org/cms-data/variables/revenue-center-medicare-provider-payment-amount)

- Short SAS Name: `RPRVDPMT`
- Long SAS Name: `REV_CNTR_PRVDR_PMT_AMT`

Contained in

- [Home Health Agency RIF](../hha-rif.md#data-documentation)

The amount Medicare paid for the services reported on the revenue center record.This field is rarely populated for Part A claims due to per-diem or DRG payments; the claim payment amounts should be used instead.For Hospital Outpatient services (also called Institutional Outpatient claims, which consist of claim type [variable called NCH_CLM_TYPE_CD]= 40), this variable can be summed across all revenue center lines for the claim to obtain the total Medicare claim payment amount.

This field is populated for those claims that are required to process through Outpatient PPS PRICER software. The type of bills (TOB) required to process through are: 12X, 13X, 14X (except Maryland providers, Indian Health Providers, hospitals located in American Samoa, Guam and Saipan and Critical Access Hospitals [CAH]); 76X; 75X and 34X if certain HCPCS are on the bill; and any outpatient type of bill with a condition code `07` and certain HCPCS. These claim types could have lines that are not required to price under OPPS rules so those lines would not have data in this field.
Additional exception: Virgin Island hospitals and hospitals that furnish only inpatient Part B services with dates of service 1/1/02 and forward.
Additional information regarding claim versus revenue-line level payments can be found in a CCW Technical Guidance document entitled: "Getting Started with Medicare Administrative Data."

The first code used to identify the detailed reason an adjustment was made (e.g. reason for denial or reducing payment).

NOTE1: This field is populated for those claims that are required to process through Outpatient PPS Pricer. The type of bills (TOB) required to process through are: 12X, 13X, 14X (except Maryland providers, Indian Health Providers, hospitals located in American Samoa, Guam and Saipan and Critical Access Hospitals (CAH)); 76X; 75X and 34X if certain HCPCS are on the bill; and any outpatient type of bill with a condition code `07` and certain HCPCS. These claim types could have lines that are not required to price under OPPS rules so those lines would not have data in this field.

Additional exception: Virgin Island hospitals and hospitals that furnish only inpatient Part B services with dates of service 1/1/02 and forward.

NOTE2: Beginning with NCH weekly process date 7/7/00, this field will be populated with data. Claims processed prior to 7/7/00 will contain spaces in this field.

|:-------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CO     | Contractual Obligations -- this group code should be used when a contractual agreement between the payer and payee, or a regulatory requirement, re- sulted in an adjustment. Generally, these adjust- ments are considered a write-off for the provider and are not billed to the patient.             |
| CR     | Corrections and Reversals -- this group code should be used for correcting a prior claim. It applies when there is a change to a previously adjudicated claim.                                                                                                                                          |
| OA     | Other Adjustments -- this group code should be used when no other group code applies to the adjustment.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| PI     | Payer Initiated Reductions -- this group code should be used when, in the opinion of the payer, the adjustment is not the responsibility of the patient, but there is no supporting contract between the provider and the payer (i.e., medical review or professional review organization adjustments). |
| PR     | Patient Responsibility -- this group should be used when the adjustment represents an amount that should be billed to the patient or insured. This group would typically be used for deductible and copay adjustments.                                                                                  |

Effective with Version 'I', this field was created to house two pieces of data. The Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) code and the HIPPS code. The APC is used to identify groupings of outpatient services. APC codes are used to calculate payment for services under OPPS. The APC is a four byte field. The HIPPS codes are used to identify patient classifications for SNFPPS, HHPPS and IRFPPS that will be used to calculate payment. The HIPPS code is a five byte field.

NOTE1: The APC field is populated for those claims that are required to process through Outpatient PPS Pricer. The type of bills (TOB) required to process through are: 12X, 13X, 14X (except Maryland providers, Indian Health Providers, hospitals located in American Samoa, Guam and Saipan and Critical Access Hospitals (CAH)); 76X; 75X and 34X if certain HCPCS are on the bill; and any outpatient type of bill with a condition code `07` and certain HCPCS. These claim types could have lines that are not required to price under OPPS rules so those lines would not have data in this field.

Additional exception: Virgin Island hospitals and hospitals that furnish only inpatient Part B services with dates of service 1/1/02 and forward.

NOTE2: Under SNFPPS, HHPPS & IRFPPS, HIPPS codes are stored in the HCPCS field. **EXCEPTION: if a HHPPS HIPPS code is downcoded/upcoded the downcoded/ upcoded HIPPS will be stored in this field.

NOTE3: Beginning with NCH weekly process date 8/18/00, this field will be populated with data. Claims processed prior to 8/18/00 will contain spaces in this field.

## [Revenue Center Discount Indicator Code](https://www.resdac.org/cms-data/variables/Revenue-Center-Discount-Indicator-Code)

- [Home Health Agency RIF](../hha-rif.md#data-documentation)

Effective with Version 'I', this code represents a factor that specifies the amount of any APC discount. The discounting factor is applied to a line item with a service indicator (part of the REV_CNTR_PMT_MTHD_IND_CD) of 'T'. The flag is applicable when more than one significant procedure is performed. **If there is no dis- counting the factor will be 1.0.**

NOTE1: This field is populated for those claims that are required to process through Outpatient PPS Pricer. The type of bills (TOB) required to process through are: 12X, 13X, 14X (except Maryland providers, Indian Health Providers, hospitals located in American Samoa, Guam and Saipan and Critical Access Hospitals (CAH)); 76X; 75X and 34X if certain HCPCS are on the bill; and any outpatient type of bill with a condition code `07` and certain HCPCS. These claim types could have lines that are not required to price under OPPS rules so those lines would not have data in this field.

Additional exception: Virgin Island hospitals and hospitals that furnish only inpatient Part B services with dates of service 1/1/02 and forward.

NOTE2: It has been discovered that this field may be populated with data on claims with dates of service prior to 7/00 (implementation of Claim Line Expansion OPPS/HHPPS). The original understanding of the new revenue center fields was that data would be populated on claims with dates of service 7/00 and forward. Data has been found in claims with dates of service prior to 7/00 because the Standard Systems have processed any claim coming in 7/00 and after, meeting the above criteria, through the Outpatient Code Editor (OCE) regardless of the dates of service.

NOTE3: VALUES D, U & T REPRESENT THE FOLLOWING: D = Discounting fraction (currently 0.5) U = Number of units T = Terminated procedure discount (currently 0.5)

The Health Care Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) is a collection of codes that represent procedures, supplies, products and services which may be provided to Medicare beneficiaries and to individuals enrolled in private health insurance programs. The codes are divided into three levels, or groups as described below:

Level I: Codes and descriptors copyrighted by the American Medical Association's Current Procedural Terminology, Fourth Edition (CPT-4).  These are 5 position numeric codes representing physician and nonphysician services.

*Note: CPT-4 codes including both long and short descriptions shall be used in accordance with the CMS/AMA agreement.  Any other use violates the AMA copyright.

Level II: Includes codes and descriptors copyrighted by the American Dental Association's Current Dental Terminology, Fifth Edition (CDT-5).  These are 5 position alpha-numeric codes comprising the D series.  All other level II codes and descriptors are approved and maintained jointly by the alpha-numeric editorial panel (consisting of CMS, the Health Insurance Association of America, and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association).  These are 5 position alpha-numeric codes representing primarily items and nonphysician services that are not represented in the level I codes.

Level III: Codes and descriptors developed by Medicare carriers for use at the local (carrier) level. These are 5 position alpha-numeric codes in the W, X, Y or Z series representing physician and nonphysician services that are not represented in the level I or level II codes.

This field was renamed to eventually accommodate the National Drug Code (NDC) and the Universal Product Code (UPC). This field could contain either of these 3 fields (there would never be an instance where more than one would come in on a claim).
The size of this field was expanded to X(24) to accommodate either of the new fields (under Version 'H' it was X(7).

The amount paid by the beneficiary to the provider for the line item service. 

NOTE: This field is populated for those claims that are required to process through Outpatient PPS Software. The type of bills (TOB) required to process through are: 12X, 13X, 14X (except Maryland providers, Indian Health Providers, hospitals located in American Samoa, Guam and Saipan and Critical Access Hospitals [CAH]); 76X; 75X and 34X if certain HCPCS are on the bill; and any outpatient type of bill with a condition code `07` and certain HCPCS. These claim types could have lines that are not required to price under OPPS rules so those lines would not have data in this field. 

Additional Exception: Virgin Island hospitals and hospitals that furnish only inpatient Part B services with dates of service 1/1/02 and forward.

Effective with Version 'I', the code used to identify how the service is priced for payment. This field is made up of two pieces of data, 1st position being the service indicator and the 2nd position being the payment indicator.

NOTE1: This field is populated for those claims that are required to process through Outpatient PPS Pricer. The type of bills (TOB) required to process through are: 12X, 13X, 14X (except Maryland providers, Indian Health Providers, hospitals located in American Samoa, Guam and Saipan and Critical Access Hospitals (CAH)); 76X; 75X and 34X if certain HCPCS are on the bill; and any outpatient type of bill with a condition code `07` and certain HCPCS. These claim types could have lines that are not required to price under OPPS rules so those lines would not have data in this field.

Additional exception: Virgin Island hospitals and hospitals that furnish only inpatient Part B services with dates of service 1/1/02 and forward.

NOTE2: It has been discovered that this field may be populated with data on claims with dates of service prior to 7/00 (implementation of Claim Line Expansion OPPS/HHPPS). The original understanding of the new revenue center fields was that data would be populated on claims with dates of service 7/00 and forward. Data has been found in claims with dates of service prior to 7/00 because the Standard Systems have processed any claim coming in 7/00 and after, meeting the above criteria, through the Outpatient Code Editor (OCE) regardless of the dates of service.

NOTE3: Effective 10/2005, this field will no longer represent the service indicator and the payment indicator. This field will now house the 2-byte payment indicator. The status indicator will be housed in a new field named: REV_CNTR_STUS_IND_CD.



<h3>Values</h3>

NOTE: Prior to 10/2005, this table contained the valid values for both the payment indicator and status indicator.  Effective 10/2005, the payment indicator codes will remain in this table and the status indicator code values will be reflected in the new table: REV_CNTR_STUS_IND_TB. Both the payment indicator and status indicator values have been expanded to 2-btyes.

## [Revenue Center Pricing Indicator Code](https://www.resdac.org/cms-data/variables/revenue-center-pricing-indicator-code-0)

- Short SAS Name: `REV_CNTR_PRCNG_IND_CD`
- Long SAS Name: `REV_PRICNG_IND_CD`

Contained in

- [Skilled Nursing Facility RIF](../snf-rif.md#data-documentation)
- [Outpatient RIF](../op-rif.md#data-documentation)
- [Inpatient RIF](../ip-rif.md#data-documentation)
- [Hospice RIF](../hospice-rif.md#data-documentation)

The code used to identify if there was a deviation from the standard method of calculating payment amount.

This field is populated for those claims that are required to process through the Outpatient PPS PRICER software. The type of bills (TOB) required to process through are: 12X,13X, 14X (except Maryland providers, Indian Health Providers, hospitals located in American Samoa, Guam and Saipan and Critical Access Hospitals [CAH]); 76X; 75X and 34X if certain HCPCS are on the bill; and any outpatient type of bill with a condition code `07` and certain HCPCS. These claim types could have lines that are not required to price under OPPS rules so those lines would not have data in this field.
Additional exception: Virgin Island hospitals and hospitals that furnish only inpatient Part B services with dates of service 1/1/02 and forward.
It has been discovered that this field may be populated with data on claims with dates of service prior to 7/00 (implementation of Claim Line Expansion OPPS/HHPPS). The original understanding of the new revenue center fields was that data would be populated on claims with dates of service 7/00 and forward. Data has been found in claims with dates of service prior to 7/00 because the Standard Systems have processed any claim coming in 7/00 and after, meeting the above criteria, through the Outpatient Code Editor (OCE) regardless of the dates of service.
VALUES D, U & T REPRESENT THE FOLLOWING:
D = Discounting fraction (currently 0.5)
U = Number of units
T = Terminated procedure discount (currently 0.5)

Charges relating to unit cost associated with the revenue center code. Exception (encounter data only): If plan (e.g. MCO) does not know the actual rate for the accommodations, $1 will be reported in the field.

NOTE1: For SNF PPS claims (when revenue center code equals `0022`), CMS has developed a SNF PRICER to compute the rate based on the provider supplied coding for the MDS RUGS III group and assessment type (HIPPS code, stored in revenue center HCPCS code field).

NOTE2: For OP PPS claims, CMS has developed a PRICER to compute the rate based on the Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC), discount factor, units of service and the wage index.

NOTE3: Under HH PPS (when revenue center code equals `0023`), CMS has developed a HHA PRICER to compute the rate. On the RAP, the rate is determined using the case mix weight associated with the HIPPS code, adjusting it for the wage index for the beneficiary's site of service, then multiplying the result by 60% or 50%, depending on whether or not the RAP is for a first episode.

On the final claim, the HIPPS code could change the payment if the therapy threshold is not met, or partial episode payment (PEP) adjustment or a significant change in condition (SCIC) adjustment. In cases of SCICs, there will be more than one `0023` revenue center line, each representing the payment made at each case-mix level.

NOTE4: For IRF PPS claims (when revenue center code equals `0024`), CMS has developed a PRICER to compute the rate based on the HIPPS/CMG (HIPPS code, stored in revenue center HCPCS code field).

Effective 10/3/2005 with the implementation of NCH/NMUD CR#2, the code used to identify the status of the line item service. This field along with the payment method indicator field is used to identify how the service was priced for payment.

NOTE1: This 2-byte indicator is being added due to an expansion of a field that currently exist on the revenue center trailer. The status indicator is currently the 1st position of the Revenue Center Payment Method Indicator Code. The payment method indicator code is being split into two 2-byte fields (payment indicator and status indicator). The expanded payment indicator will continue to be stored in the existing payment method indicator field. The split of the current payment method indicator field is due to the expansion of both pieces of date from 1-byte to 2-bytes.

NOTE2: This field is populated for those claims that are required to process through Outpatient PPS Pricer. The type of bills (TOB) required to process through are: 12X, 13X, 14X (except Maryland providers, Indian Health Providers, hospitals located in American Samoa, Guam and Saipan and Critical Access Hospitals (CAH)); 76X; 75X and 34X if certain HCPCS are on the bill; and any outpatient type of bill with a condition code `07` and certain HCPCS. These claim types could have lines that are not required to price under OPPS rules so those lines would not have data in this field.

Additional exception: Virgin Island hospitals and hospitals that furnish only inpatient Part B services.

The total charges (covered and non-covered) for all accommodations and services (related to the revenue code) for a billing period before reduction for the deductible and coinsurance amounts and before an adjustment for the cost of services provided. NOTE: For accommodation revenue center total charges must equal the rate times units (days).

EXCEPTIONS:

(1) For SNF RUGS demo claims only (9000 series revenue center codes), this field contains SNF customary accommodation charge, (ie., charges related to the accommodation revenue center code that would have been applicable if the provider had not been participating in the demo).

(2) For SNF PPS (non demo claims), when revenue center code = `0022`, the total charges will be zero.

(3) For Home Health PPS (RAPs), when revenue center code = `0023`, the total charges will equal the dollar amount for the `0023` line.

(4) For Home Health PPS (final claim), when revenue center code = `0023`, the total charges will be the sum of the revenue center code lines (other than `0023`).

(5) For Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IFR) PPS, when the revenue center code = `0024`, the total charges will be zero. For accommodation revenue codes (010X - 021X), total charges must equal the rate times the units.

(6) For encounter data, if the plan (e.g. MCO) does not know the actual charges for the accommodations the total charges will be $1 (rate) times units (days).

??? limitation
	DESCRIPTION :
	Multiple total charge '0001' revenue center codes appearing
	on outpatient, hospice and home health claim records.
	BACKGROUND :
	On outpatient, home health and hospice it appears that
	more than one '0001' revenue center code is showing
	up on the claims. The first total charge line adds
	the revenue center codes above it correctly; the
	problem exists below the first total charge line
	where garbage may be present due to the FI Standard
	System not clearing out fields before processing the
	next claim. We believe the error began with the change-
	over to a different claims processing contractor in
	1/98.
	CORRECTIVE ACTION :
	CWF created an edit to reject mulitple '0001' revenue
	center codes, effective 6/28/99. EDG's CWFMQA process
	implemented an edit to drop any revenue center line
	items below the first total charge line. The NCH
	Nearline File, as well as the 1998 Standard Analytic
	Files (SAFs), have been patched/corrected to delete
	the multiple '0001' codes where present on any of the
	institutional claim types. Also, HCIS will be cor-
	recting the revenue center summaries during the next
	refresh.
	The NCH_PATCH_CD field will reflect a value '10'.

A quantitative measure (unit) of the number of times the service or procedure being reported was performed according to the revenue center/HCPCS code definition as described on an institutional claim.

Depending on type of service, units are measured by number of covered days in a particular accommodation, pints of blood, emergency room visits, clinic visits, dialysis treatments (sessions or days), outpatient therapy visits, and outpatient clinical diagnostic laboratory tests.

NOTE1: When revenue center code = `0022` (SNF PPS) the unit count will reflect the number of covered days for each HIPPS code and, if applicable, the number of visits for each rehab therapy code.

Description of the different unit of service measures by revenue center code beginning on page 18: http://cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/Downloads/clm104c25.pdf

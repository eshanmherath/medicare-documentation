## [Equated BIC](https://www.resdac.org/cms-data/variables/Equated-BIC)

- Short SAS Name: `EQ_BIC`

Contained in

- [MedPAR RIF](../medpar-rif.md#data-documentation)

The code categorizing groups of `BIC`s representing similar relationships between the beneficiary and primary wage earner.

NOTE: The equatable `BIC` module electronically matches two records that contain different `BIC`s where it is apparent both are records for the same beneficiary. It validates the `BIC` and returns a base `BIC` under which to house the record in the National Claims History (NCH) databases. (All records for a beneficiary are stored under a single `BIC`).

## [MEDPAR Admission Death Day Count](https://www.resdac.org/cms-data/variables/MEDPAR-Admission-Death-Day-Count)

- Short SAS Name: `DEATHDAY`

Contained in

- [MedPAR RIF](../medpar-rif.md#data-documentation)

The count of the number of days from the date the beneficiary was admitted to a facility to the beneficiary's date of death (DOD).

??? derivation
	This field is derived by counting the number of days between the MEDPAR admission date (the admission date present on the first claim record included in the stay) and MEDPAR beneficiary death date (the death date present on the enrollment database, which is accessed prior to creation of the quarterly MEDPAR file).

??? limitation
	DESCRIPTION :
	MEDPAR Admission Death Day Count calculated incorrectly, on both the 3/00 and 6/00 MEDPAR updates.
	BACKGROUND :
	Both the 3/00 and 6/00 MEDPAR updates incorrectly calculated the mortality days; i.e., days between the admission date and the beneficiary date of death. Users of the regular unencrypted MEDPAR file, this is not a problem, as the count can be calculated using the admission date and the date of death.  The problem is with the encrypted file (the expanded modified MEDPAR) because the fields needed to calculate the mortality days are ranged.
	CORRECTIVE ACTION :
	The problem was corrected with the 12/00 MEDPAR update.  NOTE:  For users of the expanded modified MEDPAR file who needs the mortality days, the 12/00 update of the FY1999 file can be given as a replacement.

Contained in

- [MedPAR RIF](../medpar-rif.md#data-documentation)

The amount of money (rounded to whole dollars) identified as the beneficiary's liability for the blood deductible for the stay.

??? derivation
	This field is derived by accumulating the beneficiary blood deductible liability amount that is present on any of the claim records included in the stay (i.e., the sum of the blood deductibles reported on the claims that comprise the stay).

??? limitation
	DESCRIPTION :
	It was discovered that the blood deductible amounts were incorrect on the Old MEDPAR Files.
	BACKGROUND    :
	Users of the MEDPAR data were comparing money amounts and counts present on the new MEDPAR file (created 6/95 using NCH Nearline File as the source) to that reported on the old MEDPAR File (created 3/95 and prior from claims from the Medicare Quality Assurance System) for Fiscal Year 1994.  They discovered that the blood deductible amount on the new MEDPAR was greater than that of the old MEDPAR.
	
	During NCH's investigation it was determined that the old 500-character MEDPAR incorrectly used a different field to report the blood deductible; specifically the noncovered
	charges derived from blood use Revenue Center codes 0380-0389.  The new program correctly used the NCH field, BENE_BLOOD_DDCTBL_LBLTY_AMT, which is derived from a value code (CLM_VAL_AMT associated with CLM_VAL_CD = '6').
	
	It is believed that all MEDPAR files created prior to 6/95 in the 500 character version are affected. MEDPAR 500 was first available with calendar year and fiscal year 9/91 updates for year 1987 forward.
	
	NOTE:  This anamoly also impacts the DRG Price Amount on the old MEDPAR file because it is calculated from a number of fields including the blood deductible.

## [MEDPAR Beneficiary Death Date](https://www.resdac.org/cms-data/variables/MEDPAR-Beneficiary-Death-Date)

- Short SAS Name: `DEATHDT`

Contained in

- [MedPAR RIF](../medpar-rif.md#data-documentation)

The date the beneficiary died.

??? derivation
	This field comes from the beneficiary death date, if present on the enrollment database, which is accessed prior to creation of the quarterly MEDPAR file.

??? limitation
	  DESCRIPTION :
	The Date of Death on the MEDPAR files were not up-to-date for four cycles.
	BACKGROUND  :
	 The MEDPAR process pulls in 10 segments of the HISKEW file, to get the date of death.  The HISKEW file names were changed with no notification the change was being made.  Because of this, MEDPAR kept using the HISKEW that was created in June 2000.
	The incomplete MEDPAR cycles are: 12/2000, 3/2001,  6/2001 and 9/2001 (9/2000 MEDPAR was not run).
	CORRECTIVE ACTION :
	Since this anamoly causes no major problem to the prime user of this data, a rerun will not take place.
	NOTE:  The 12/01 quarterly update will access up-to-date information.

## [MEDPAR Beneficiary Death Date Verified Code](https://www.resdac.org/cms-data/variables/MEDPAR-Beneficiary-Death-Date-Verified-Code)

- Short SAS Name: `DEATHCD`

Contained in

- [MedPAR RIF](../medpar-rif.md#data-documentation)

The code indicating whether the beneficiary's date of death has been verified or originated from a claim record.

??? derivation
	This field is derived from the enrollment database's beneficiary source death date code, or from the presence of a claim status code = '20' (expired) on the last claim record included in the stay.

The amount (called the 'DRG price' for purposes of MEDPAR analysis) that would have been paid if no deductibles, coinsurance, primary payers, or outliers were involved (rounded to whole dollars).

??? derivation
	This field is derived by accumulating the following amounts: MEDPAR Medicare payment amount, MEDPAR beneficiary primary payer payment amount, MEDPAR beneficiary coinsurance liability amount, MEDPAR beneficiary Inpatient deductible liability amount, MEDPAR beneficiary blood deductible amount; and then subtracting from the sum the MEDPAR DRG outlier approved payment amount.

??? limitation
	DESCRIPTION :
	IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE DRG PRICE AMOUNT WSA INCORRECT ON THE OLD MEDPAR FILES.
	BACKGROUND  :
	Users of the MEDPAR data were comparing money amounts and counts present on the new MEDPAR file (created 6/95 using NCH Nearline File as the source) to that reported on the old MEDPAR File (created 3/95 and prior from claims from the Medicare Quality Assurance System) for Fiscal Year 1994.  They discovered that the DRG price amount on the new MEDPAR contained incorrect amounts.
	
	NOTE:  This anamoly occurs because the DRG price amount is calculated from a number of fields including the blood deductible amount, which was discovered to be populated incorrectly.
	
	During NCH's investigation it was determined that the old 500-character MEDPAR incorrectly used a different field to report the blood deductible; specifically the noncovered charges derived from blood use Revenue Center codes 0380-0389.  The new program correctly used the NCH field, BENE_BLOOD_DDCTBL_LBLTY_AMT, which is derived from a value code (CLM_VAL_AMT associated with CLM_VAL_CD = '6').
	
	It is believed that all MEDPAR files created prior to 6/95 in the 500 character version were affected. MEDPAR 500 was first available with calendar year and fiscal year 9/91  updates for year 1987 forward.

Amount of payment made from the Medicare trust fund for the services covered by the claim record. Generally, the amount is calculated by the fi; and represents what was paid to the institutional provider, with the exceptions noted below.

NOTE: In some situations, a negative claim payment amount may be present; e.g., (1) when a beneficiary is charged the full deductible during a short stay and the deductible exceeded the amount Medicare pays; or (2) when a beneficiary is charged a coinsurance amount during a long stay and the coinsurance amount exceeds the amount Medicare pays (most prevalent situation involves psych hospitals who are paid a daily per diem rate no matter what the charges are.)

Under IP PPS, Inpatient hospital services are paid based on a predetermined rate per discharge, using the DRG patient classification system and the pricer program. On the IP PPS claim, the payment amount includes the DRG outlier approved payment amount, disproportionate share (since 05/1/86), in- direct medical education (since 10/1/88), total PPS capital (since 10/1/91). It does not include the pass thru amounts (i.e., capital-related costs, direct medical education costs, kidney acquisition costs, bad debts); or any beneficiary-paid amounts (i.e., deductibles and coinsurance); or any other payer reimbursement.

Under SNF PPS, SNFs will classify beneficiaries using the patient classification system known as rugs III. For the SNF PPS claim, the SNF pricer will calculate/return the rate for each revenue center line item with revenue center code = `0022`; multiply the rate times the units count; and then sum the amount payable for all lines with revenue center code `0022` to determine the total claim payment amount.

Exceptions: For claims involving demos and BBA encounter data, the amount reported in this field May not just represent the actual provider payment.

For demo ids `01`,`02`,`03`,`04` -- claims contain amount paid to the provider, except that special 'differentials' paid outside the normal payment system are not included.

For demo ids `05`,`15` -- encounter data 'claims'contain amount Medicare would have paid under FFS, instead of the actual payment to the MCO.

For demo ids `06`,`07`,`08` -- claims contain actual provider payment but represent a special negotiated bundled payment for both part a and part B services. To identify what the conventional provider part a payment would have been, check value code = `y4`.

For BBA encounter data (non-demo) -- 'claims' contain amount Medicare would have paid under FFS, instead of the actual payment to the BBA plan.

On an institutional claim, the National Provider Identifier (NPI) number assigned to uniquely identify the institutional provider certified by Medicare to provide services to the beneficiary.

NOTE: Effective May 2007, the NPI will be- come the national standard identifier for covered health care providers. NPIs will replace current OSCAR provider number, UPINs, NSC numbers, and local contractor provider identification numbers (PINs) on standard HIPPA claim transactions. (During the NPI transition phase (4/3/06 - 5/23/07) the capability was there for the NCH to receive NPIs along with an existing legacy number (UPIN, PIN, OSCAR provider number, etc.)).

NOTE1: CMS has determined that dual provider identifiers (old legacy numbers and new NPI) must be available in the NCH. After the 5/07 NPI implelmentation, the standard system main- tainers will add the legacy number to the claim when it is adjudicated. We will continue to receive the OSCAR provider number and any currently issued UPINs. Effective May 2007, no NEW UPINs (legacy number) will be generated for NEW physicians (Part B and outpatient claims), so there will only be NPIs sent in to the NCH for those physicians.
